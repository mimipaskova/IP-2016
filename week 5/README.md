# IP-2016 Week 5 - Arrays (1-dimensional)

## Exercise

### Task 1 - Queries

Given an array of real numbers and one more real number (called query) you have to tell up to which number to sum in order the sum to be bigger than the query.

**Input:**

The first line contains N meaning the size of the array.
The next N lines contain each element of the array.
Next line contains M - the number of queries to be made.
The next M lines contain each query.

**Output:**

The output contains M lines each denoting the index up to which we have to sum the real numbers or `-1` if this is not possible.
